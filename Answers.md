1.  What is React JS and what problems does it try and solve?
React JS is a library, although many people refer to it as a framework, that is used to creat reusable user interface components. Facebook created it as a means of solving the problem of everchanging data and updating their interface simultaneously.


2.  What does it mean to _think_ in react?
Thinking in react means to think if boxes and reusabilty but mostly it means that the state of a component is reactive. Whenever the render function/method changes the state reacts to this change.


3.  Briefly describe some of the differences between a Class/Stateful component and a Functional/Presentational component.
Class components are unique in that they can hold data as its state while functional compenents can't do this they can be converted to class
syntax so its possible that they themselves can hold their own state of data. If a functional component needs to have shared data with its parent it will use the props method to pass this sata to its body.



4.  Describe state.
State is the data that is given to a component usually from an outside source like in this project today.



5.  Describe props.
Props is the vehicle for passing that state data from the parent component to the children components that might need it.
